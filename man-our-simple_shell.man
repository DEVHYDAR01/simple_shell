[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       $ /hsh [options] [file]


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Simple_Shell  is  a command language interpreter that executes commands
       read from the standard input.  Clone of sh


[1mReturn Value[0m
       Always returns status of the previously executed command ( 0 if no com-
       mand was executed) , number is going to mean exit fail codes


[1mPATH[0m
       look through the PATH env variable for executable program file location
       and execute it.

       Invocation in +2n simple_shell can be invoked  both  interactively  and
       non-interactively.   If  invoked with standard input not connected to a
       terminal, it reads and executes received commands in order.

       If simple_shell is invoked with standard input connected to a terminal,
       an interactive shell is  opened.   When  executing  interactively,  the

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Data_shell  is  a  sh-compatible command language interpreter that exe-
       cutes commands read from the standard input or from a file.


[1mARGUMENTS[0m
       If arguments remain after option processing, the first argument is  as-
       sumed  to be the name of a file containing shell commands. DATASH reads
       and executes commands fromthis file, then exits. DATASH exit status  is
       the  exit status of the last command executed in the script. If no com-
       mands are executed, the exit status is 0. An attemptis  first  made  to
       open  the file in the current directory, and, if no file is found, then
       the shell searches the directories in PATH for the script.


[1mOPTIONS[0m
       simple_shell Command options will be typed after the main command  fol-
       lowed by a space and a
        '-' symbol.


[1mEXAMPLE[0m
       $ ls -l


[1mExit Status[0m
       DATASH  exit status of an executed command is the value returned by the
       waitpid system call or equivalent function. A command which exits  with
       a zero exit status has succeeded. An exit status of zero indicates suc-
       cess. A non-zero exit status indicates failure.

       If  a command is not found, the child process created to execute it re-
       turns a status of 127.

       All builtins return zero on success and one or two on  incorrect  usage
       (indicated by a corresponding error message).


[1mBUGS[0m
