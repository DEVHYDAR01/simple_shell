.SH ARGUMENTS
If arguments remain after option processing, the first argument is assumed to be the name of a file containing shell commands. DATASH reads and executes commands fromthis file, then exits. DATASH exit status is the exit status of the last command executed in the script. If no commands are executed, the exit status is 0. An attemptis first made to open the file in the current directory, and, if no file is found, then the shell searches the directories in PATH for the script.

.SH OPTIONS

.B simple_shell
Command options will be typed after the main command followed by a space and a
 '-' symbol.

.SH EXAMPLE

.SH Exit Status

DATASH\fR exit status of an executed command is the value returned by the waitpid system call or equivalent function. A command which exits with a zero exit status has succeeded. An exit status of zero indicates success. A non-zero exit status indicates failure.

If a command is not found, the child process created to execute it returns a status of 127.

All builtins return zero on success and one or two on incorrect usage (indicated by a corresponding error message).
